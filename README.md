# Project Goal:
This project helps users filter their clothing items based on the weather. 

# Technologies and Techniques:
-The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with ESLint ensuring code quality and consistency. 
-The database is connected via Mongoose, leveraging MongoDB to manage data. 
-Models with schemas are defined to structure the data, and routes and controllers are configured to handle API requests. 
-Error handling is implemented with a focus on different error codes to enhance reliability.

# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
